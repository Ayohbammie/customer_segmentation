# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis aimed at understanding customer behavior using customer segmentation techniques. The primary methods utilized in this analysis are Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and K-Means Clustering. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their behavior and characteristics, enabling more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer service.

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: see `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Open and run the notebooks in the following order:
   - `1_EDA.ipynb`
   - `2_PCA.ipynb`
   - `3_KMeans_Clustering.ipynb`
3. Review the results in the `results/` directory.

## Analysis Details

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we:
- Loaded and cleaned the data.
- Performed descriptive statistics.
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and other relevant aspects of the data.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA was conducted to:
- Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Identify the principal components that capture the most variance.
- Visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space.

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering was applied to:
- Segment the customers into distinct groups.
- Analyze the characteristics of each segment.
- Visualize the clusters and interpret the results.

## Results

The final output includes:
- Identification of key customer segments.
- Visualizations of the clusters.
- Insights into customer behavior patterns.
